A SWIFT code, also known as a Bank Identifier Code (BIC), is a unique identifier of a bank's branch or headquarter.
It ensures that international wire transfers are directed to the correct bank and branch, acting as a bank's unique
address within the global financial network. Currently, SWIFT-related data for various countries is stored in
a spreadsheet. While this format is convenient for offline management, we need to make this data accessible to our
applications.
